                The most common species of fish found at Newfound Lake are: Landlocked Salmon, Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass, Rainbow Trout, Pickerel, and Yellow Perch.
                The species that most focus on catching, however, are smallmouth bass and rainbow trout. Smallmouth are typically seen as more of a competition fish because they
                taste awful, and rainbow trout are seen as a food fish with a small competitive aspect to catching them. Obviously this changes during a fishing derby, of which
                Newfound hosts many, but most enjoy a more relaxing, refreshing, and recharging fishing experience with casual personal records being kept out of principle alone.

                The first, and most important piece of fishing, is finding a good spot. This is difficult in a community that guards the secret of their best locations more heavily
                than any of their personal possessions. Most maps of Newfound will give general locations of where certain fish can be found, but these are very general and give no
                indications as to where the fish actually reside within them.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Although finding a good fishing spot seems like an impossible task, there are a few methods that don't involve finding an actual location, but still provide ample
                opportunity to catch fish. The most popular method involves taking a boat down the shore of the lake at a slow speed while reducing the vibrations made by the boat as
                much as possible. This is known as "trolling" and it's extremely effective for catching trout who like to reside near docks, moorings, and rafts because of the
                shelter they provide for laying eggs. Trolling is only effective in the early morning because as soon as it gets warmer with direct sunlight and other boats make
                it out onto the lake, the trout are much less likely to bite.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                While trolling is one effective method, it involves quite a few expensive resources. Similar results can be achieved with just a kayak with more emphasis on stationary
                casting under docks. When attempting to fish out of the early morning grace period, however, it's very difficult to even get a bite around docks. This is when finding
                a location can be extremely beneficial to continue fishing during the day. A good rule of thumb for finding a fishing spot is rocks, vegetation, overhanging trees,
                and/or very little human activity. Obviously a combination of all of these is ideal, but just any one of them can be effective. Around <a href="mayhew.html">Mayhew Island</a>,
                there is a rocky outcropping that extends a reasonable distance out from the shore. Many of these rocks are shallow enough to stand on in the water, which makes
                them perfect for catching fish. This area of the lake has no vegetation, overhanging trees, and it has a lot of human activity, but it's still possible to catch fish
                here.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Finding a good spot to fish may be the most important part of fishing at Newfound, but a good setup is also important. Before discussing baits, lures, and other attractors,
                it's important to consider the rod setup itself. Most amateur fishermen will use whatever rod they have that, more than likely, someone else bought at some point in
                the past. This could work if the setup happens to be halfway decent, but it often is not. The first piece to focus on is the reel. There are three main types of reels
                that should be used around Newfound. The first is the push-button reel, the second is the spinning reel, and the third is the baitcaster reel. The push-button reel is 
                ideal for children due to its ease of use and how comparatively difficult it is to tangle. The second and third options are considered to be more viable for avid
                fishermen.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The spinning reel is ideal for trout, perch, and pickerel because they typically put up less of a fight than the bass or salmon. Spinning reels support lighter
                line, typically ranging from 2 lb. monofilament up to 12 lb. monofilament. This means that the line is thinner and more difficult for the fish to see, which is instrumental
                in catching the more optically picky trout. Spinning reels are also typically paired with a more stationary setup on the end of the line due to their use in a
                cast and wait fishing experience, although there are many active setups that also pair nicely with a spinning reel. An avid fisherman will always have one or two
                spinning reels with slightly different use cases. One as an "ultralight" and the other as a more general purpose setup. This leads into the different types of rods that
                are paired with spinning reels. Rods can range from the aforementioned ultralight all the way up to striped bass heavyweight rods and higher. An ultralight is often
                necessary for catching smaller fish, such as panfish, or sunfish, that need a smaller bait. These rods are paired with tiny monofilament line and are usually collapsable
                for an easily to transport and quick to set up rig. An ultralight rod is useless for trout or pickerel, which often put up enough of a fight to easily snap tiny
                monofilament, but not enough to necessitate the use of a baitcaster. This is where a general use rod is needed with a heavier 6-8 lb. monofilament line and a more rigid
                construction. An ultralight, collapsable rod can be used with a more general use setup, but a heavier rod is typically recommended.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Following the theme of heavier rods, a baitcaster reel setup is the most well-rounded rig for general fishing due to its versatility and exceptional performance. Baitcasters
                are not easy to learn and thus are not usually recommended for beginners, but anyone who wants to get into fishing should put the effort into learning how to use one.
                Baitcasters are more sensitive, have a much higher "vibration resolution", are much smoother, and provide unparalleled levels of control over the line. With a lure that hugs
                the bottom of a body of water, such as a crankbait, a baitcaster much more effectively transmits the surface that the bait is touching with a taught line. This is due to
                most baitcasters being equipped with braided line, which is different from monofilament because it's more similar to a rope than a string of plastic. Braid does not stretch,
                whereas monofilament has a tendency to stretch far beyond its original length due to its elastic properties. Because of its woven nature, braid also tends to be stronger and
                support higher amounts of weight. Most braid will support anywhere from 15-70 lbs. depending on its rating, which is ideal for fighting heavier fish or removing a lure 
                from a tree branch or other snag. This comes with the drawback of braid being more visible in the water, which can scare some species of fish away, but most of the time
                baitcasters are used to catch bass, which are optically impaired compared to their trout counterparts. As previously mentioned, baitcasters also provide control over the
                line that is not present in a spinning reel. Baitcasters have a horizontally mounted spinning line holder that necessitates the use of one's finger to slow the speed at
                which it rotates. This is where the learning curve comes from and it is why baitcasters are not a beginner friendly reel. If the user fails to slow the spin of the line holder
                before the lure hits the water, the holder will continue to spin at the same speed while the lure is slowed by the impact with the water. This causes the line to collect
                inside of the reel because it isn't being pulled out of the reel as fast as it's being released by the holder. This causes a nasty, tangled mess called a rat's nest, which
                can sometimes take hours to untangle given unlucky enough circumstances. While this might seem entirely unappealing, baitcasters provide the most interactive, fun, and rewarding
                experience while fishing due to the constant attention that they require. Baitcasters are often paired with heavier, longer rods that amplify the vibrations from the line and 
				ensure that a fight with a strong fish won't cause anything to snap.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once a rod and reel is selected, it's important to make sure the rig on the end of the line matches the setup and the intended species. If the intention is to catch trout,
                a spinning reel setup is recommended as previously mentioned. One of the most effective lures for catching trout is called a "rooster tail". These lures come in a multitude
                of colors, but all consist of three basic parts: a hook, synthetic feathering, and a shiny spoon. Rooster tails are an active lure, meaning the user has to constantly reel
                them in to rotate the spoon and attract fish. Speaking of spoons, a spoon alone can also act as an effective lure. Spoons are a concave metal scoop that are shiny and catch
                the sun when they're rotating in the water. Spoons are another example of an active lure, but trout fishing is also dominated by passive lures that only need to be cast into
                the water and left until a bite is felt. The most famous is the classic bobber setup with a hook holding a live worm suspended anywhere from one to five feet below the bobber.
                This setup is not only effective in catching fish, but it's also very beginner friendly with a clear indication of a fish on the line. Another passive/active rig that enjoys 
                popular use is the Carolina rig. The Carolina rig consists of a synthetic or live bait on a hook hanging a length from a weight further up the line. The distance between the
                bait and the weight is determined by the length of the plants on the bottom of the body of water. The bait is supposed to "swim" just above this plant matter, or if there is
                no plant matter, about a foot from the bottom of the water. This lure is passive/active because it can also be paired with occasional movement to reposition the bait, but most
                of the time it's stationary under the surface.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Bass fishing with a baitcaster, as previously mentioned, is much more active and involved, therefore the types of lures follow suit. All of these lures are ideal for catching
				bass due to their active nature and usually large size. One of the most popular types of lures is known as a "crankbait". These fish-shaped, hard plastic lures are painted in 
				bright, attractive, and shiny colors that entice fish along with a rattler inside. The two most important pieces of this lure, however, are the bill on the front and the types of 
				hooks it uses. The bill comes in many different shapes that change its behavior in the water, but the concept is more or less the same regardless. The bill allows the lure to 
				dive under the surface of the water and swim with a fish-like motion when it's being reeled in. The second most important piece, the hookset, is known as a treble hook and it's 
				easily recognizable by its three pronged design. The typical crankbait has two of these hooks to ensure a successful catch.
				<br/>
				Another popular rig is called the wacky rig and it's mainly known for its incredible simplicity. A wacky rig consists of a hook and a worm and that's it. Usually the worm is 
				synthetic, but some choose to use a normal, live worm. A wacky rig either hooks the worm dead center and allows both ends to dangle perpendicular to the hook, or uses a special 
				rubber band (kind of like an o-ring) to hold the hook and worm together so that the worm doesn't weaken with multiple punctures. 
				<br/>
				A popular lure type for topwater fishing is a plastic, air filled frog that sits on top of the water. The technique used to move this lure imitates the way a frog might meander across the 
				surface, which is incredibly appealing to bass. These frogs sit halfway above and below the surface and usually have tassels streaming behind them to imitate a frog's legs. 
				Sometimes these frogs have actual legs, but tassels are more common. The hooks on top water frog lures curl up and around the rear of the frog and the squishy nature of the 
				lure ensures that the barbs don't get stuck on plants that the frog glides over, but they do become stuck when a fish bites down.

				Although this guide may make fishing seem daunting, expensive, and riddled with technicalities, fish are ultimately pretty dumb and I've had success with a two-foot length of
				line, a hook, and a piece of bread. No reel, no rod, no lure, just my hands, line, and bread. Fishing can be extremely accessible and Newfound Lake is the perfect location to
				try it out, and, if you're unsuccessful, at least you'll be able to admire the view.
